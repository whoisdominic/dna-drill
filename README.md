# D&A Drill

## Data structures

1. Strings
2. Arrays
3. Hash table
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Linked Lists
7. Matrix
8. Trees
9. Binary Trees
10. Graphs
11. Tries (they are effectively trees, but itâ€™s still good to call them out separately).
12. Heaps
13. Vectors (2d array)

## Basics (tasks)

- Creation
- Traversal
- CRUD operations
- Comparison

## Sorting algorithms

- Quick
- Bubble
- Merge
- Selection
- Insertion
- Counting
- Radix
- Bucket
- Comb
- Shell

### How to practice

In your language of choice setup a new repo. You should have a folder called `structures` and another called `sorting`

In the `structures` folder add a file for each data structure in the list. Do the same for each type of sorting algorithm. These files should be empty.

Commit your changes to `main/master` branch

**Bonus**: *Create test cases for each data structure and sorting algorithm. That way you can be sure you are exercising correctly.*

Each day of practice create a new branch with the following naming convention `drill-{date}` for example if you are practicing on 03/15/23 your branch would be `drill-03-15-23`. Using a timer keep track of how long it takes you to get through them all.

Perform all of the basic tasks for each **Data structure.**

Commit the branch and push it up.
